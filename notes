	been noodling with making a nodebeat-alike for a while
	lots of messy half-baked ideas in circles.clj
	feel like i need to start over with a fresh file
	inspirations

	i am suffering from analysis paralysis about the best way to implement this
		need to just pick something and go  
		i can always rewrite something if i want to
		need to just do a minimum viable version, and go from there
	starting a new ns, minimal-nodebeat
		design choices
			only simple pulse sources
			and simple pulse sinks
				to start out, sinks just change color when they receive a note
			state is a single atom
			entities are simple maps
				all have a :kind tag used for method dispatching
