# Graphenspiel

Graphenspiel is a graph-based musical toy.

It is very incomplete at this point.

I'm using [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil) (and thereby [Processing](http://processing.org)) for the UI.

Eventually it will likely use [Overtone](http://overtone.github.com/) to produce sounds, although I might offer an easier-to-setup fallback mode to a less comprehensive JVM synthesizer lib.

I have also thought about making it generate generic [OSC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control) events that could be used in any number of audio systems.

## Usage


Right now the main way I run it is to interact from a REPL or something like SLIME/VimClojure.  I personally use SLIMV.

You can also `lein run` or `java -jar` the uberjar to play with it.

In the applet, you can create sink nodes with left click, and source nodes with right click.  Pressing `r` will reset to the initial state, and `q` will kill the JVM.
